# ✅ Manifest Fix Verification

## 🚨 What Was Fixed

The extension was completely broken due to invalid CSP directives in manifest.json. Manifest V3 has strict limitations on external scripts.

### Changes Made:

1. **Removed Stripe CSP directive** that was causing loading failure:
   - ❌ Before: `"script-src 'self' https://js.stripe.com 'wasm-unsafe-eval'"`
   - ✅ After: `"script-src 'self' 'wasm-unsafe-eval'"`

2. **Removed external Stripe.js script** from HTML
   - Manifest V3 doesn't allow external scripts in extension pages

3. **Simplified payment to external redirect**
   - No CSP issues
   - Simple `window.open()` to payment page
   - Works immediately

## 🧪 Verification Steps

### 1. Reload Extension
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find "Smart Bookmarks" extension
3. Click the refresh icon (or "Retry" if it shows error)
4. **Extension should load without errors**

### 2. Test Core Features
1. Click extension icon in toolbar
2. Popup should open normally
3. Test these features:
   - ✅ Focus timer displays
   - ✅ Start/Stop timer works
   - ✅ Chart shows data
   - ✅ Notes tab functions
   - ✅ Settings work

### 3. Test Pro Modal
1. Click "Website Blocking" card
2. Pro modal should appear
3. Click "Upgrade to Pro"
4. New tab opens to payment page
5. Modal shows success message

### 4. Check Console
1. Right-click popup → Inspect
2. Check Console tab
3. Should see NO errors about:
   - CSP violations
   - Stripe not defined
   - Manifest loading

## ✅ Expected Results

- Extension loads successfully
- No manifest errors
- All core features work
- Pro upgrade opens external page
- No console errors

## 🚀 Payment Integration Options

Since we can't use Stripe.js directly in Manifest V3:

1. **External Payment Page** (Current approach)
   - Host payment page on your website
   - Extension opens it in new tab
   - Simple and reliable

2. **Stripe Payment Links**
   - Create in Stripe Dashboard
   - Direct URL to hosted checkout
   - No code needed

3. **Chrome Payments API** (Future)
   - Native Chrome payment integration
   - No external dependencies

The extension should now be **fully functional** with a simple payment redirect!
