# Focus Chart Debug Summary

## What I've Done

I've added comprehensive debugging to help diagnose why the focus chart isn't appearing in your Chrome extension. Here's what has been implemented:

### 1. **Debug Logging Added** (in `popup-prod.js`)

#### At Initialization (lines 82-106):
- Logs when chart initialization starts
- Checks which tab is currently active
- Verifies if the chart container exists in the DOM
- Reports container dimensions and visibility
- Adds a red "TEST: Chart loading..." message to verify DOM updates work

#### In updateFocusChart() method (lines 780-799):
- Logs when the method is called
- Lists all elements with "chart" in their ID if container not found
- Shows the focus sessions data being processed
- Logs the calculated values for the last 7 days

#### When Setting Chart HTML (lines 876-881):
- Shows the length of generated HTML
- Displays first 200 characters of the chart HTML
- Confirms when chart is rendered successfully

### 2. **How to Use the Debug Info**

1. **Open the Chrome extension** and click on the **Focus tab**
2. **Open Chrome DevTools** (Right-click → Inspect → Console tab)
3. **Look for messages** starting with:
   - `📊` - Chart initialization milestones
   - `🔍 DEBUG:` - Detailed debug information
   - `❌` - Error messages

### 3. **What to Look For**

#### Success Scenario:
```
📊 Initializing focus chart
🔍 DEBUG: Chart container found: true
🔍 DEBUG: Container visible: true
📊 Rendering CSS-based chart
✅ CSS chart rendered successfully
```

#### Common Issues:
- **"Chart container not found"** - The Focus tab HTML hasn't loaded
- **"Container visible: false"** - The tab might not be active
- **"Container dimensions: 0 x 0"** - CSS might be hiding the container
- **"Last 7 days data: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]"** - No focus session data stored

### 4. **Test File Created**

Open `test-focus-chart-debug.html` in your browser for a complete debugging guide.

### 5. **Next Steps**

After you reload the extension and check the console:

1. **If you see the red "TEST: Chart loading..." text** but no chart:
   - The DOM update works, but chart generation might be failing
   - Check for JavaScript errors in the console

2. **If you don't see any debug messages**:
   - The extension might not be using popup-prod.html
   - Check manifest.json to verify the popup file

3. **If the container dimensions are 0x0**:
   - There might be CSS issues hiding the container
   - The Focus tab might not be properly activated

### 6. **Quick Fix to Try**

If the Focus tab isn't the default tab, try clicking on it manually after opening the extension. The chart initialization happens 100ms after page load, so it might be trying to render before the Focus tab is visible.

## Report Back

Please share:
1. All console messages starting with 📊 or 🔍 DEBUG:
2. Any error messages (in red) in the console
3. Whether you see the red "TEST: Chart loading..." text
4. The values shown for "Last 7 days data:"

This information will help pinpoint exactly where the issue is occurring.
